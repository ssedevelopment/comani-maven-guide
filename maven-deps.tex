\subsection{Dependencies}
Usally, every project have external dependencies. Maven takes controll of it for you if you define them inside your pom.xml file.
\begin{lstlisting}
	<dependencies>
	...
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.group.id</groupId>
			<artifactId>artifact-id-of-project</artifactId>
			<version>1.29.2</version>
		</dependency>
	...
	</dependencies>
\end{lstlisting}
Now, maven looks for a project identified by "com.group.id" and "artifact-id-of-project" with the version "1.29.2" in your local repository. If this project isn't stored there, maven will search for it in any configured and offical remote repositories.
