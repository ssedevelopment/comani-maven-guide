\subsection{Phases and Goals} \label{chapter:intro:phases}
The next big things are phases and goals. 
The most important phases are:
\begin{itemize} 
	\item package: Compiles the sources and reads the <package> configuration from your pom and package it into the desired format. 
	\item install: Does nearly the same as package but install the project in your local maven repository too.
	\item compile: Only compiles all source files
	\item test: Runs all test. Test classes starts with "Test" prefix or defined inside the pom.xml
	\item deploy: Same as install but it will publish the project to a remote repository
\end{itemize}
You run those phases directly through maven. 
Command-line example:
\begin{lstlisting}
	mvn install
	mvn package
	mvn test
	mvn clean package # remove all stored jars etc.
	mvn -f other-pom.xml install
\end{lstlisting}
